<Warning>
**This is in BETA**  
This API can be used almost identically to the search API with just a few different parameters.
</Warning>

## Notes

* This endpoint executes a Tako Visualization Search using a natural language query. Tako will parse the query and perform a collection and keyword search to assemble a visualization relevant to the query.
* If the query requests multiple series of data (i.e. “Tesla Stock Price vs Tesla Net Income”), Tako will adjust the chart so the data makes sense. This may necessitate using both a left and right y-axis to visualize data of far different dimensions/magnitudes, or using a percent change since start y-axis when there are many series.
